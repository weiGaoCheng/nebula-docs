    $ git clone --branch {{python.branch}} https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python.git
    ```

  - To install the daily development version, run the following command to download the source code from the `master` branch:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python.git
    ```

## Core of the example code


NebulaGraph Python clients provides Connection Pool and Session Pool methods to connect to NebulaGraph. Using the Connection Pool method requires users to manage sessions by themselves.

- Session Pool

  For details about all the code, see [SessionPoolExample.py](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/blob/{{python.branch}}/example/SessionPoolExample.py).

  For limitations of using the Session Pool method, see [Example of using session pool](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/blob/{{python.branch}}/README.md#example-of-using-session-pool).

- Connection Pool

  For details about all the code, see [Example](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-python/tree/{{python.branch}}/example).
